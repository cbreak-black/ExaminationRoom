\section{Introduction\label{Introduction}}

Researching the effect of the viewing of stereoscopic stimuli requires a different tool than usual user testing. The stimuli have to be more complex, and more dynamic. While traditional tests only require simple input and don't need to react on it, changing the stimuli based on what happened is often a requirement for the tests planed in stereoscopic vision research.

The following sections will introduce several examples of use cases, tests in which the framework should enhance the procedures and lessen the work done in test design and execution.
In the features section, some important abilities needed in those tests are detailed.
