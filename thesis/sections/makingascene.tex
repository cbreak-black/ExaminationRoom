\section{Making a scene}
\paragraph{}
There are two ways to create a testing scene.
The original way is to write code for everything, including scene graph buildup.
The new way is to use the UI of \ER\ to create the scene graph,
and only write code to change the scene for each query.
In both cases, the code for interaction and logging has to be written.


\subsection{Pure Lua}
\paragraph{}
\todo{set up variables}
\todo{set up scene graph}
\todo{set up data structures for scene description}
\todo{set up event handlers and progression functions}
\todo{log reply correctness and progress in input handler}

\subsection{UI assisted}
\paragraph{}
\todo{similar than pure lua}
\todo{scene graph created in UI}
\todo{other things done in separate files}


\subsection{Log Format}
\paragraph{}
\todo{In query-response tests: log query and response}

\todo{Describe how}
