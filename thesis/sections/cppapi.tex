\section{C++ API}
\paragraph{}
The C++ API is the interface on which all others are based.
Important parts are exposed to LUA, where they can be used by a scene designer, others are used only by the GUI.

It is documented in detail in the source code with Doxygen comments (see example header in the appendix).
From those comments, documentation in various formats can easily be created.
