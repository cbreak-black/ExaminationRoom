\begin{abstract}
Viewing stereoscopic movies or images is unnatural. The focus and vergence of the eyes have to be decoupled. Artefacts and inconsistencies of a stereoscopic image with the real world cause confusion and decrease viewing pleasure.

Topic of this thesis is to write a Tool that enables exploration of those problems and quantifying them by providing a flexible and extensible framework for user testing. Challenges include understanding the needs in this relatively new field of research, as well as the commonly used methods in user testing.
