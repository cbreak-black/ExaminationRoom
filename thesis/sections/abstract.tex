Viewing stereoscopic movies or images is unnatural. The focus and vergence of the eyes have to be decoupled. This strains the eyes, and can lead to fatigue, which makes the consumption of stereoscopic information over longer periods of times hard. But what are the physiological and psychological limits of stereoscopic viewing fatigue? And how can stereo images be composed to reduce fatigue?

Topic of this thesis is to write a Tool that enables exploration of those and similar other questions by providing a flexible and extensible framework for user testing. It is currently unclear how fatigue can be measured properly, and what scenes can be used to specifically test fatigue. Finding out which methods work and which do not is also part of this thesis.
