%Viewing stereoscopic movies or images is unnatural.
% The focus and vergence of the eyes have to be decoupled.
% Artefacts and inconsistencies of a stereoscopic image with the real world cause confusion and decrease viewing pleasure.

Many requirements of stereo vision tests are unique to this area.
Topic of this thesis is to write a Tool that enables exploration of those problems and quantifying them by providing a flexible and extensible framework for user testing.
Challenges include understanding the needs in this relatively new field of research, as well as the commonly used methods in user testing.

This thesis presents the motivation, design and implementation of a generalized stereoscopic testing application.
