\todo{Usability}

\begin{itemize}
\item Usability
\item Scene mechanic design is very low level
\item Anaglyph rendering is fairly primitive
\item Selection of objects can only be done in tree view, not in the scene
\item Selection is not visible in the scene
\item Container subclassing could be made easier with preDraw and postDraw.
\item Access to objects from lua only through references, not by name. By-name (or any other indirect) access would allow replacement and undo handling.
\end{itemize}
